Part 3: Analysis

Please refer to PART2_README, as running this part of the code is the same as on part 2.
Make sure to specify the source and target configuration for the sentence pair you want to display the heatmap for.

In addition note that you may run "heatmap.py" (with relevent cnonfiguration - see "--help") to get the heatmap of an example using the trained model.

**Important note**: make sure to add an additional space at the end of the src/trg sentences (as in the trainin data) for proper running of the model.
